      "      <p>HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 21, 2005-- </p>      <p>Enjoy Media Holdings Limited (Pink Sheets: EJYM), a print media and advertising services company in China , announced today that it has signed an advertising contract with China Travel Service (Guangdong) Limited ( <a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E1E1715151716161714171C11174432171C011C1300175C1D021E07155C1D00150E4A4143444A0E400E400E404B414B4540400E08.aspx'>www.gdcts.com </a>) (CTS). Mr. Bill Lu, President of Enjoy Media, said, &quot;CTS, a major travel service provider in China , has appointed us to produce advertisements for their tour package promotions, starting this month. The Chinese travel industry, a US$36 billion market in 2004, is set to grow significantly as the Chinese government relaxed the international travel policy for its citizens at the start of 2005 to include more countries in Southeast Asia and Europe . CTS is planning more promotions to coincide with the new demands from Chinese travelers. Enjoy Media can provide a highly-targeted audience for CTS with our growing network.&quot; </p>\n",
      "      <p>CTS is the leading travel service operator in Southern China with 100 retail outlets and over 400 affiliated agencies. Since its inception in 1990, CTS has grown tremendously providing reservations for hotel, airline, transportation and events, and has become one of the best-known travel brands in China . For four consecutive years, CTS is one of the top six China 's best international travel agencies and ranked first in Guangdong province. In 2004, CTS served over one million customers, recorded revenue of US$96 million.</p>      \n",
